## ✅ Pros of WebSocket
**✔ Low Latency:** Ideal for real-time applications with minimal delay
**✔ Persistent Connection:** Reduces overhead by avoiding repeated HTTP requests
**✔ Efficient Bandwidth Usage:** Uses a single connection instead of polling
**✔ Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Supported by most modern browsers and servers

## ❌ Cons of WebSocket
**✖ Lack of Built-in Features:** No built-in reconnection, event-based messaging, or fallback mechanisms
**✖ Difficult to Scale:** Requires additional configurations (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) for multi-instance setups
**✖ Limited Browser Support in Older Devices**

# WebSockets Use Cases
