## 📡 How **Socket.IO** Works

1. A **client** establishes a WebSocket connection to the **server**.
2. The **server** listens for custom events (e.g., "newMessage", "stockUpdate").
3. The **server** emits events to all **connected clients** in real-time.
4. Clients receive the events and update their UI **instantly**.
