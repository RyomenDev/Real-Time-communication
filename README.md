# Real-Time Communication Examples

This repository provides practical implementations of various real-time communication techniques, including WebSocket, Socket.IO, Server-Sent Events (SSE), gRPC, and MQTT. Each example includes setup instructions, code snippets, and explanations to help developers integrate real-time features into their applications.

## üöÄ Technologies Covered
- **WebSocket**: Native full-duplex communication
- **Socket.IO**: WebSocket abstraction with automatic reconnection
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: One-way server-to-client updates
- **gRPC (WebSockets)**: High-performance RPC with bidirectional streaming
- **MQTT**: Lightweight messaging for IoT

### Conclusion
- Use **WebSockets** for low-latency, bi-directional communication.
- Use **Socket.IO** if you need auto-reconnection, event-based messaging, and fallbacks.
- Use **SSE** for simple, one-way real-time updates.
- Use **gRPC** if integrating with microservices and efficiency is critical.
- Use **MQTT** for IoT and real-time messaging in constrained networks.
